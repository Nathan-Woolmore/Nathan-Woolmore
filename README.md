## About Me
Hey there! I'm Nate, a self-taught app developer from Auckland, New Zealand. I discovered my passion for coding through the joy of problem-solving and the creative freedom it provides. When I'm not immersed in coding, you can usually find me catching waves or hitting the gym. I'm always eager to collaborate with like-minded people on exciting projects that make a positive impact. If you've got an idea or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!
